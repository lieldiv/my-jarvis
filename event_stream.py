"""
event_stream.py — a tiny in-process pub/sub used to push live progress
events (vision-action steps, confirmation requests) to the HUD over
Server-Sent Events, instead of the HUD polling an endpoint.

SSE rather than a full WebSocket: one-directional (backend -> HUD) is all
this needs, it's plain HTTP so nothing new to install (no flask-socketio,
no separate ASGI server), and the browser's built-in EventSource handles
reconnects for you. If you later want the HUD to push things back over the
same connection (vs. the existing POST /api/command), swap this for
flask-socketio without changing anything in vision_action.py — it only
ever calls push_event().

MULTI-USER BUILD: subscribers are now keyed by user_id. The original
single-tenant version broadcast every event to every connected tab — fine
with one account, but in the multi-user build it meant one user's proposed
calendar event or drafted email was pushed to every *other* signed-in
user's browser too. push_event() now requires a user_id and only reaches
that user's own subscribed tab(s).
