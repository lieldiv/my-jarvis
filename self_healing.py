"""
self_healing.py — autonomous self-testing/self-correction loop.

This is what stands between "JARVIS writes code" and "you become the QA
department". Given a goal and a code-generation function, it:
  1. runs the current candidate script in a sandboxed subprocess,
  2. captures stdout/stderr/return code (no exceptions escape to the caller),
  3. if it failed, hands the traceback + code back to the LLM and asks for a
     fixed version,
  4. repeats up to MAX_ITERATIONS, returning the first success or a final
     failure report — either way, one clean answer for the user, not a
     stream of tracebacks to copy-paste.

Sandboxing notes:
  - Scripts are written to WORKSPACE/sandbox_scripts and run with
    cwd=WORKSPACE, so relative file access from generated code stays
    confined the same way file_tools.py confines it.
  - subprocess.run with a hard timeout — a generated infinite loop can't
    hang the assistant forever.
  - This restricts *where* code runs and *for how long*, not *what syscalls*
    it can make (that would need an OS-level sandbox/container, which is a
    good next step if you start letting it write more ambitious scripts).
    Treat it as a blast-radius limiter, not a security boundary against
    hostile code — it doesn't need to be one, since JARVIS is generating the
    code from your own goal, not running untrusted third-party input.

# app-specific. This closes the cheapest, most direct part of the exposure
# (reading os.environ), but is NOT a full sandbox: the timeout/cwd
# confinement above still don't stop the script from opening an absolute
# path (e.g. users.db, which stores every signed-in user's plaintext
# Google OAuth token) or making outbound network calls. Real containment
# of that needs OS-level isolation (a container/unprivileged-user per
# execution), which this patch deliberately does not attempt.
