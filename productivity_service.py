"""
productivity_service.py — the "smart schedule + email" layer that ties
google_service.py and microsoft_service.py together into one interface for
app.py's tools and daily_briefing.py's scheduler.

MULTI-USER BUILD: every function now takes a `user_id` and passes it through
to google_service.py's per-user token lookups. microsoft_service.py is NOT
part of this build's login flow (Google-only sign-in, per the plan) and
isn't currently configured with any credentials at all, so its CONFIGURED
flag is False and the microsoft_service.* calls below are dead branches for
now — left in place, unchanged, so Microsoft support is a later addition
rather than a rewrite.

Autonomy level (chosen deliberately, not a default): JARVIS reads calendars
and mailboxes freely, but never creates an event or sends an email without
a spoken confirmation first. Reads go straight through; writes are parked
via guardrails.request_confirmation, the same pattern file_tools.py uses
for delete/kill — one audited confirm-to-act path for every "irreversible"
action in the codebase, not a special case just for this feature.
