# Wiring the new modules into `app.py`

Drop `guardrails.py`, `vision_action.py`, and `file_tools.py` into the
project root, next to `app.py`. Add `psutil` to `requirements.txt`. Then:

> **`self_healing.py` (the `write_and_test_code` tool it backed) was
> removed from this fork by a deliberate security decision, not an
> oversight** — an OWASP audit found it ran LLM-generated Python with the
> full parent process environment (every API key/secret this app holds)
> and no filesystem/network boundary beyond the script's own working
> directory, on a deployment where more than one Google account can sign
> in. Unlike every other write-capable tool here it also wasn't gated
> behind confirm-to-act. Do not re-add it from this doc without first
> giving it real OS-level sandboxing (a container/unprivileged-user per
> execution) — an env allowlist alone is not enough on a multi-tenant
> deployment.

## 1. Startup — refuse to run elevated, ensure the workspace exists

At the very top of `app.py`, right after the existing imports:

```python
from guardrails import refuse_if_elevated, ensure_workspace
import file_tools, vision_action

refuse_if_elevated()   # raises and exits if launched as admin/root
ensure_workspace()
```

This replaces nothing — it's a new pair of lines before the Groq client
setup. If someone double-clicks a "Run as administrator" shortcut, the
process exits immediately with a clear message instead of silently running
with more power than the sandbox checks assume.

## 2. New tools in `TOOLS` and `TOOL_IMPL`

Append to the existing `TOOLS` list (same schema as your current entries):

```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "computer_use",
        "description": (
            "General screen control for anything without a dedicated tool: "
            "clicking UI elements, filling in forms, browser navigation, "
            "dragging, typing into any app. Describe the visual goal in "
            "plain language, e.g. 'open Gmail and click Compose'."
        ),
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"goal": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["goal"],
        },
    },
},
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "list_workspace",
        "description": "List files in the JARVIS workspace (or a subfolder of it).",
        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}}},
    },
},
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "read_workspace_file",
        "description": "Read a text file from the JARVIS workspace.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["path"],
        },
    },
},
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "write_workspace_file",
        "description": "Write/overwrite a text file in the JARVIS workspace.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "content": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["path", "content"],
        },
    },
},
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "delete_workspace_path",
        "description": "Delete a file or folder in the JARVIS workspace. Requires user confirmation before it actually happens.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["path"],
        },
    },
},
```

And the matching implementations:

```python
def _computer_use(args):
    result = vision_action.vision_action_loop(groq_client, args.get("goal", ""))
    return result

def _delete_workspace_path(args):
    result = file_tools.delete_path(args.get("path", ""))
    if result["status"] == "confirmation_required":
        return f"Please confirm, sir: {result['message']} (token {result['token']})"
    return result["message"]

TOOL_IMPL.update({
    "computer_use": _computer_use,
    "list_workspace": lambda args: file_tools.list_dir(args.get("path", ".")),
    "read_workspace_file": lambda args: file_tools.read_file(args.get("path", "")),
    "write_workspace_file": lambda args: file_tools.write_file(args.get("path", ""), args.get("content", "")),
    "delete_workspace_path": _delete_workspace_path,
})
```

Note `computer_use` can take several seconds to tens of seconds (multiple
screenshots per loop) — the existing `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` cap on chained tool
calls still applies on top of this, so a confused model can't compound a
slow loop with more slow loops indefinitely.

## 3. Confirmation endpoint

```python
from guardrails import resolve_confirmation, list_pending

@app.route("/api/confirm/<token>", methods=["POST"])
def confirm_action(token):
    approve = bool((request.json or {}).get("approve", False))
    message = resolve_confirmation(token, approve)
    return jsonify({"response": message})

@app.route("/api/pending", methods=["GET"])
def pending_confirmations():
    return jsonify(list_pending())
```

In the HUD, poll `/api/pending` (or just surface the token JARVIS speaks
back in its response) and show a confirm/cancel prompt that POSTs to
`/api/confirm/<token>`.

## 4. Streaming progress into the HUD's terminal log — SSE

`event_stream.py` is a small in-process pub/sub. `vision_action_loop` takes
an optional `on_step` callback — point it at `event_stream.push_event` and
every step becomes a push to any connected HUD tab, no polling.

```python
import event_stream

def _computer_use(args):
    return vision_action.vision_action_loop(
        groq_client, args.get("goal", ""), on_step=event_stream.push_event
    )
```

Add the SSE route:

```python
from flask import Response
import queue as _queue

@app.route("/api/stream")
def stream():
    def gen():
        q = event_stream.subscribe()
        try:
            while True:
                try:
                    event = q.get(timeout=15)
                    yield event_stream.format_sse(event)
                except _queue.Empty:
                    yield ": keepalive\n\n"   # comment line, keeps proxies/browsers from timing out the connection
        finally:
            event_stream.unsubscribe(q)

    return Response(
        gen(),
        mimetype="text/event-stream",
        headers={"Cache-Control": "no-cache", "X-Accel-Buffering": "no"},
    )
```

**Important:** this is a long-lived connection, so the dev server must
handle more than one request at a time or `/api/stream` will block
`/api/command`. Change the bottom of `app.py`:

```python
app.run(host=host, port=port, debug=debug_mode, threaded=True)
```

Also push confirmation requests the same way, so the HUD can pop the
prompt the instant a delete/kill is requested rather than waiting for the
next `/api/command` reply to mention it — call
`event_stream.push_event({"type": "confirmation_required", "token": token, "message": message})`
right where `_delete_workspace_path` currently builds its return string.

On the HUD side, `EventSource` is built into every browser — no library:

```javascript
const stream = new EventSource("/api/stream");
stream.onmessage = (e) => {
  const event = JSON.parse(e.data);
  appendToTerminalLog(event);            // your existing scrolling log panel
  if (event.type === "confirmation_required") {
    showConfirmPrompt(event.token, event.message);   // POST to /api/confirm/<token>
  }
};
```

`EventSource` auto-reconnects if the connection drops (e.g. a Flask
autoreload restart in dev), so you don't need to handle that yourself.
