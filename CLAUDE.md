# J.A.R.V.I.S — Cloud multi-user fork — Claude Code notes

Multi-user cloud voice assistant, deployed at **https://jarvis-cloud-oifj.onrender.com**
(Render free tier). The GitHub repo and the Render service's display name were
both renamed to `my-jarvis`, but Render does not change a service's
auto-assigned `.onrender.com` subdomain on rename — it's fixed at creation —
so the actual live URL is still the old one. Confirmed directly from the
service's own boot log ("Available at your primary URL") and real request
Referer headers, not assumed. Anyone with a Google account added as a Test user can sign
in from a phone or computer browser and get their own calendar/inbox/voice
assistant. Two pillars remain from the original single-user app; the third
(desktop automation) is intentionally out of scope here — there's no user
device for a cloud server to control:

1. **Schedule/email management is the central use case** — calendar + inbox.
2. Conversational voice assistant (Groq LLM + edge-tts, browser HUD in
   [templates/index.html](templates/index.html)). Speech recognition
   (`recognition.lang`) is Hebrew (`he-IL`) — the actual user speaks Hebrew —
   but JARVIS's own replies stay English (`SYSTEM_PROMPT` says so explicitly;
   tried full Hebrew TTS once, the two available voices — he-IL-AvriNeural/
   HilaNeural — read as unprofessional, reverted). Wake/stop/yes-no phrase
   matching accepts both languages since he-IL recognition isn't guaranteed
   to transcribe English loanwords.
3. Flexible general-purpose agent — but trimmed hard from the original: no
   Spotify (removed — it was one server-wide shared account, not per-user
   OAuth), no generic web_search/play_media (removed — both called Python's
   `webbrowser.open()` **server-side**, which opens nothing on a remote
   user's device; that only worked in the original single-tenant desktop
   app because the server and the user were the same machine), no desktop
   automation (`JARVIS_DESKTOP_TOOLS=false` on Render — `open_application`/
   `close_application`/`computer_use` are omitted from the tool list sent to
   Groq entirely when this is false, not just refused at call time — saves
   tokens against the free-tier rate limit too). Also removed:
   `write_and_test_code` — an OWASP audit found it ran LLM-generated Python
   with the full parent process environment (every API key/secret this app
   holds) and no filesystem/network boundary beyond the script's own
   working directory, on a deployment where more than one Google account
   can be signed in; unlike every other write-capable tool it also wasn't
   gated behind confirm-to-act. Removed outright rather than patched —
   see git history (commit removing self_healing.py) if this ever needs
   reviving, but any revival needs real OS-level sandboxing first, not
   just an env allowlist. What's left: calculate, get_weather + file tools
   (now per-user sandboxed, see below), the schedule/email/reminder tools,
   `find_nearby_places`
   (confirm-to-open Google Maps search, see below), `get_market_summary`
   (free market-index lookup, no AI involved, see below), and
   `get_current_info` (general news/current-events lookup via
   [tavily_service.py](tavily_service.py), see below) — the last three are
   the only tools that touch anything outside the app's own data, and all
   are deliberately scoped narrow.

## ⚠️ Do not confuse this with the other two JARVIS folders

- `C:\Users\User\Desktop\free 400 שקל` — the **single-user** desktop app the
  user runs day to day on their own PC. Has its own separate CLAUDE.md.
- `C:\Users\User\Desktop\jarvis_final` — where single-user development happens.
- **This folder** (`האפליקציה הסופית`) is a **separate fork**, created
  specifically to become a multi-tenant cloud product without touching or
  risking the working single-user app. Code does not sync between them —
  changes made here stay here unless explicitly asked to port them back.

## Deployment

- Render Blueprint: [render.yaml](render.yaml). `gunicorn app:app --workers 1
  --threads 16`. **Exactly one worker is load-bearing** — `daily_briefing.py`'s
  scheduler thread starts once at module import time (not gated behind
  `if __name__ == "__main__"`, which gunicorn never executes — this was a
  real bug: the scheduler never ran in production until fixed). More than
  one worker would start multiple copies and double/triple-send reminders.
  Threads=16 because each open browser tab holds one `/api/stream` (SSE)
  connection open indefinitely; 2 threads meant two simultaneous tabs
  exhausted the pool and hung every other request including sign-in.
- **Free tier, deliberately** (user chose $0 over persistence): no disk, so
  `users.db` — accounts, Google tokens, **and reminders** — is wiped on every
  restart/spin-down (~15 min idle). A reminder set for later can silently
  vanish if the server recycles before it fires. Real persistence needs a
  durable store (Render's free Postgres is the not-yet-taken next step).
- Two separate Google OAuth clients exist in the same Cloud project: a
  "Desktop app" one (used by `free 400 שקל`, loopback-only) and a "Web
  application" one (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET` here, registered redirect URI
  must exactly match the live Render URL — it changed once already when
  Render appended a random suffix to the service name).
- Google OAuth consent screen is in **Testing** status — only emails added
  under Audience → Test users can sign in at all (`console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience`).
  This is also the access-control mechanism keeping the free-tier Groq quota
  from strangers, not just a dev inconvenience.

## Multi-user architecture (the part that's different from the single-user app)

- [users.py](users.py) — SQLite (`users.db`), one row per Google account
  (`id` = Google's `sub`), replacing the single-tenant `.google_cache/token.json`.
  Also holds the `reminders` table.
- [guardrails.py](guardrails.py) — `user_workspace_dir(user_id)` confines
  the file tools to a per-user subtree (`WORKSPACE_DIR/users/<id>/`)
  instead of one shared folder — **this was a
  real cross-user bug**: before the fix, any signed-in user could read/
  overwrite/delete any other user's files. `resolve_safe_path(path, user_id=...)`
  is now the required form for any multi-user caller.
- [event_stream.py](event_stream.py) — SSE pub/sub, **keyed by user_id**.
  `push_event(event, user_id)` requires the id (no silent-broadcast default)
  — the original single-tenant version broadcast every event to every
  connected tab, which in the multi-user build meant one user's proposed
  calendar event/drafted email was pushed to every *other* signed-in user's
  browser too. Fixed; `/api/stream` now subscribes per-session.
- **Confirm-to-act ownership**: `app._confirm_owner_denial(token)` verifies
  the requesting session's `user_id` against the token's stored
  `meta["user_id"]` before `/api/confirm/<token>` or its `/edit` variant do
  anything — added after the event_stream fix above, since a leaked token
  without this check could still be acted on by the wrong person.
  `guardrails.request_confirmation(..., meta={...})` / `update_pending_meta()`
  carry that ownership (and, for composed emails, attachments) through edits.
- **Reminders & weekly summary** ([daily_briefing.py](daily_briefing.py)) —
  delivered by **email** (`google_service.send_email`, through the user's own
  Gmail connection), not SSE — SSE only reaches a tab that's open right now,
  which defeats the point of a reminder. One background thread, checked once
  a minute: due reminders (`users.get_due_reminders`) get emailed and marked
  delivered; weekly summary (`JARVIS_WEEKLY_SUMMARY`, default Sunday 08:00
  local) emails every currently-connected user
  (`users.list_connected_user_ids`) their week ahead.
- **Compose Email modal** (`/api/compose/draft` + `/api/compose/send` in
  app.py, UI in index.html) — a proper form (To/Reason/Files) instead of a
  canned chat command. Draft asks Groq for a `SUBJECT:`/`BODY:` formatted
  response (not JSON — more forgiving of an LLM's punctuation than strict
  JSON parsing would be). Attachments travel as base64 inside JSON (not
  multipart/form-data, for consistency with the rest of the API), capped at
  `MAX_ATTACHMENTS=3` / `MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES=4MB` each — real limits, not
  decorative, enforced both client-side (immediate feedback) and server-side.
- Groq's `_time_context()` (app.py) injects the real current local date/time
  + UTC offset into every request — without it the model either guessed
  dates or stamped the user's spoken local time with a `Z` (UTC) suffix
  unchanged, silently shifting every calendar event/reminder by the local
  offset. `LOCAL_TZ` (`JARVIS_TIMEZONE` env var, default `Asia/Jerusalem`)
  is used consistently for this, for `_format_time()`, and for the weekly
  scheduler's fire-time calculation.

## Why get_current_info exists (Groq has no live internet access)

Groq's models (everything else in this app runs on Groq — `MODEL_NAME` in
app.py) are static, frozen at their training cutoff, with zero live internet
access — asked "did the stock market drop this week", they can only guess
or admit they don't know. Unlike ChatGPT's web app, JARVIS never had a real
web-browsing tool wired in — the old `web_search` tool (removed earlier)
only ever called `webbrowser.open()`, it never fed search results back to
the model either. General market-mood questions specifically are answered
for free with zero search at all — see `get_market_summary` below.

[tavily_service.py](tavily_service.py) fixes the general case: Tavily's
free tier (no credit card, 1,000 requests/month) is purpose-built for
LLM search — feed it a question, get back a synthesized answer plus the
sources it drew from. Wired to exactly one tool, `get_current_info`, used
only when the question needs current information the frozen Groq model
can't know — SYSTEM_PROMPT is explicit that this isn't a general second
LLM backend or an excuse to search reflexively (same "narrow and
deliberately so" philosophy as `find_nearby_places`). Needs its own
`TAVILY_API_KEY` env var (get one at https://tavily.com — sign up, key is
generated automatically); degrades to a spoken "not set up" message
rather than failing if unset. (An earlier version of this used Gemini
instead — its free tier turned out to require Google Cloud billing setup
even to use, which defeated the point; replaced outright rather than kept
as a fallback.)

## Why get_market_summary exists (free, zero AI, for market questions)

[stocks_service.py](stocks_service.py)'s `get_market_summary()` answers
"how's the market doing" / "did stocks drop this week" by fetching the
major US indices (S&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq) from the same zero-key Yahoo
Finance endpoint the `📈 מניות` HUD button uses — no LLM call, no API key,
can't be blocked by any billing gate. Listed ahead of `get_current_info`
in both the TOOLS schema and each tool's own description, so the model
reaches for the free one first for general market-mood questions;
`get_current_info` stays for genuinely non-market current-events
questions.

## Known gotchas

- **Groq free-tier rate limit is tight** — a brand-new free account
  exhausted its quota after ~6 demo commands. Every round trip resends the
  *entire* history + system prompt + every tool schema, and
  `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` chains multiple calls per single user command. Already
  mitigated: `MODEL_NAME="openai/gpt-oss-20b"` (not 120b — much more
  generous free budget), `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS=2`, `MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES=12`,
  and `ACTIVE_TOOLS` trims desktop-only tool schemas entirely rather than
  just refusing them at call time. If it's still hit constantly, the actual
  fix is Groq's paid (cheap, pay-as-you-go) tier — creating new free
  accounts is not a real solution, confirmed by direct experience.
- **`MAX_TOKENS` must stay generous (1024, not 200)** — gpt-oss models spend
  tokens on a hidden "analysis" channel before the tool-call JSON, and Groq
  counts that against `max_tokens`. Too low → truncated JSON → 400
  `tool_use_failed`. `_complete_with_retry()` retries once on that specific
  error, but don't shrink `MAX_TOKENS` back down.
- **Mobile performance**: this HUD has several full-viewport
  `backdrop-filter: blur()` layers (including the sign-in gate, visible
  immediately on load) plus multiple simultaneous glow/rotation animations
  — reported as a visible freeze on first paint on phone that desktop didn't
  have. `@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` drops backdrop-filter
  and the purely decorative animations on touch devices; desktop keeps the
  full effect (mouse/trackpad has hover+fine pointer regardless of window
  width).
- **Mixed Hebrew/English text renders out of order** without `dir="auto"` —
  the page has no `dir="rtl"`, so a Hebrew sentence with an embedded English
  quoted term (`say "WAKE UP" or "good morning"`) visibly scrambles word
  order. Every element that can hold this kind of mixed text needs
  `dir="auto"` (mic-gate title, hologram display, status line, error text,
  each dynamically-created log entry) — the browser then picks each
  element's own direction from its first strong character.
- **No calendar-event or email delete/edit-after-send tools exist** — only
  create, and only *before* approval (the Compose/Inbox-reply EDIT button
  rewrites a still-*pending* proposal, not something already sent). Test
  events created during verification get left on the real calendar to
  remove manually.
- `spotify_login.py`, `SPOTIFY_*` env vars, and the `spotipy` dependency are
  gone from this fork entirely (removed, not just disabled) — don't
  reintroduce references to them.

## Setup / running locally (rare — this fork is meant to run on Render)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python google_login.py      # Desktop-type OAuth client only; Render uses the Web-type client + env vars instead
python app.py
```
See [README.md](README.md) for the full Google Cloud Console + Render
walkthrough. The user is non-technical with terminals/dashboards and needs
very explicit, field-by-field, screenshot-driven guidance through any of
this — established pattern, not a one-off preference.
