"""
J.A.R.V.I.S backend — Flask + Groq + edge-tts

Major changes from the original version:
  1. SECURITY: no hardcoded API key fallback, debug mode off by default,
     server binds to localhost only unless explicitly opted into LAN access,
     and app launching no longer runs through a shell (removes command injection).
  2. BRAIN: intent detection is no longer "if 'weather' in text" string matching.
     The LLM is given real tools (function calling) and decides which to call,
     so it understands phrasing the old keyword matching would miss entirely
     (and doesn't misfire on words like "closed" containing "close").
  3. MEMORY: the assistant now keeps short-term conversation history, so
     follow-up questions ("what about tomorrow?") work.
  4. RELIABILITY: every external call (weather, TTS, subprocess) is wrapped
     so one failure returns a spoken error instead of crashing the request
     or leaving the user with a silent HUD.
  5. NEW TOOLS: draw_shape_in_paint (mouse automation to draw a circle),
     and calculate (safe AST-based arithmetic, typed into the Calculator
     app so it's visible on screen). See README for setup and known
     limitations of each.
