"""
guardrails.py — the safety layer every new JARVIS capability goes through.

Nothing in vision_action.py or file_tools.py touches the filesystem, a
process, or the OS directly. They all call through here first. That's
deliberate: one audited module is easier to trust than "we remembered to
check" scattered across multiple files.

Three protections live here:
  1. Sandboxing      — resolve_safe_path() confines all file work to a single
                        JARVIS_WORKSPACE folder, with an explicit denylist as
                        defense-in-depth even inside it.
  2. No admin         — refuse_if_admin() stops the whole app from starting
                        if launched elevated.
  3. Confirm-to-act    — a pending-confirmation registry for anything
                        destructive (delete, kill process), surfaced to the
                        HUD instead of executed silently.

# update_pending()/update_pending_meta() could interleave. The lock is only
